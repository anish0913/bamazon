# Overview

This application is an Amazon-like storefront. The user is able to select from 10 products to purchases from. The use will be prompted which item number to choose from and how much of the product you would like to purchases. It will then display the price and department of the product along with the stock inventory. Once finished it will display an updated inventory table.
